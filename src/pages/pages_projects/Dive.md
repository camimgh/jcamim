## Planning
Before we could begin creating our project, we had to decide upon a prompt.

We chose to build the front-end of an app focused on **removing barriers to expressing and sharing ideas.**

### Brainstorming Potential Audiences
We then tried to brainstorm potential audiences that could best fit this prompt. We came up with a whole slew of ideas such as:
- College students
    - Students who won't raise their hand / shyness
    - Difficulty budgeting college orgnanizations
- English majors/Aspiring authors
    - Github for writers
    - Writer's block
    - Plannre for writing
- Everyone
    - Sharing cultures over a social media platform
        - Problem: Forgetting your own culture through generations
        - Problem: Understanding each other's cultures
        - Can possibly narrow to a cooking app or something
        - Difficulty getting in touch with culture as first generation person living in America
        - Cultural tagging and visibility
    - Connecting with friends during quraantine
        - Intensifying connection across digital interaction
- Art students
- Performers
- Elementary School/children
    - more engagement with creative writing classes

We started talking more and more about our cultural backgrounds and identities, whatit was like growing up in our ethnic households, and the many difficulties that came with being a first generation student. From language barriers with our parents to feeling too "Americanized" to being alienated from our culture, we all realized we shared a very similar experience despite coming from such different backgrounds. 

We realized that we were all so extremely passionate about this idea and decided to choose it as the focus of our app.

### Empathy Mapping
We started to develop potential problem statements to properly narrow the scope of our project ot tackle specific issues. In order to do this, we created **empathy maps** for our potential user audience. These were maps that helped us better understand our users, their needs, and their problems. It was broken into four sections: what the user **says**, what the user **thinks**, what the user **does** and what the user **feels**.

Says:
- "I'm not able to talk to some of my relatives"
- "I wish I knew more about our traditions"
- "I want to leanr more but it's so complex I don't know where to start"
Thinks:
- I want to know more about their culture but I don't want to be insensitive
- Maybe if I'm more open about my culture, people might treat me differently
Does:
- travels
- asks questions
- watches movies and documentaries
Feels:
- excluded
- ashamed
- inadequate
- frustrated
- discouraged

### How Might We...
After these, we were able to isolate some unifying issues and problems that users ran into, and we compiled these into "How Might we" (HMW) statements:
- HMW help people learn about their own background and culture
- HMW get individuals to familiarize themselves with other backgrounds and cultures
- HMW help people take collective action in a social movement
- HMW raise awareness about other cultures 

### Problem Statement
We then drafted up our problem statement to guid eus for the rest of our project:
> How can we help our generatoin feel more connected and accepted within their culture? How can we help our generation better understand cultural experiences that differ from their own? How can we help make our generation more comfortable with talking about their culture?

### Ideating
We then did something known as Crazy 8s where you have 5 minutes to draw pictures of 8 potential solutions to our problem statement. We came up with these ideas:
- Party time! Dress in cultural attire and talk about your culture and background
- Digital museum: show off your travels and investigations to other cultures and countries
- One on One talks / Pen pal
    - paired with someone who either a) can relate with you or b) can help you out with whatever you're struggling with with regards to your culture
- Library of culture
- Culture trips - tours to understand where you came from, travel to historical places, learn more about traditoins
- Elder talks - conversations between older and oyunger generations to find out where we come from and how our culture has evolved throughout the years
- Text message
- Story page
- Slam poetry event
- Large community chat
- Entertainment cultural media

### Feature Development
Once we did this, we tried to envision how our app would look like. We decided we wanted to create an app that encouraged conversations surrounding culture since one of the biggest barriers to culture was a stigma surrounding its discussion. We knew the app would then be primarily a “pen pal app”, as we personally found that one on one connections were more meaningful and led to longer and more thorough conversations than group ones. Some other features we made:
- **Gamifying the app** - maintain userbase and encourage consistent use
- **Pen pal** - one on one conversations with the flexibility o fbeing a bunch of different kinds of conversations
- **Story feature**
- **Tutorial** - how to use hte app
- **Quest system**

## Prototyping
### Paper Prototypes
We started off with paper prototypes, drawing out the app to figure out what stuck. Here are some features we liked from our paper prototypes:
- text only option, text w/ call enabled, call only options
- question mark for conversational prompts
- mutual selection -- both need to add each other to show up in contacts list
- live matching and conversation
- transparency with the algorithm on what you matched on
- loading screen
- terms of service -- community pledge
- profile creation
- privacy and customization with display of profile
- reporting and blocking
- forum
- resources

## User Surveys
We then created an 8 question user survey
