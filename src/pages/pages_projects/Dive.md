Dive is a mobile app built with *Typescript* and *React* that connects people to others inside or outside of their culture to encourage diversity, personal connection, and friendship.

My team of 5 worked on the front-end of Dive for Microsoft's [New Technologist program](https://newtechnologists.com).

## Planning
Before we could begin creating our project, we had to decide upon a prompt.

We chose to build the front-end of an app focused on **removing barriers to expressing and sharing ideas.**
